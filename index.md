# Hi, I'm Saket
Welcome to my ICS4U portfolio. I’ll use this site to post my work and reflections.

## Highlights
- 🔧 Project 1: *(title)* – *(1–2 lines about what it does)*
- 🧠 Concept I learned:I have primarily learned how to use the basic functions of java and the logic behind the basics. 
- 📝 Blog/Reflection: [Reflection #1](./posts/first_reflection.md)
- [Reflection #2](./posts/Second.md).

## About me
A short intro (interests, goals, tools I’m learning).
-I am a determined indiviual who enjoys the psycological thriller genre and the genre of future speculation. I will be use gitHub to perform the assignments and evaluations. I am a gun nerd and I love 
to learn about the history of weaopnry.  I have done coding for 1 year and I probably have progressed to a intermediate level. I hopefully can get into Wilfred Laurier or TMU for accounting or finance.
I have a passion for money and the influence it has over the entire world. I also like cooking and learning new things to cook.
