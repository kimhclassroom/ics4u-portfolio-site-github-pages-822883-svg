# Hi, I'm Saket

## About me   
A short intro (interests, goals, tools I’m learning).
-I am a determined indiviual who enjoys the psycological thriller genre and the genre of future speculation. I will be use gitHub to perform the assignments and evaluations. I am a gun nerd and I love 
to learn about the history of weaoponry.  I have done coding for 1 year and I probably have progressed to a intermediate level. I hopefully can get into Wilfred Laurier or TMU for accounting or finance.
I have a passion for money and the influence it has over the entire world. I also like cooking and learning new things to cook.
